"""TODO: Add a proper docstring here.

This is a placeholder docstring for this charm library. Docstrings are
presented on Charmhub and updated whenever you push a new version of the
library.

Complete documentation about creating and documenting libraries can be found
in the SDK docs at https://juju.is/docs/sdk/libraries.

See `charmcraft publish-lib` and `charmcraft fetch-lib` for details of how to
share and consume charm libraries. They serve to enhance collaboration
between charmers. Use a charmer's libraries for classes that handle
integration with their charm.

Bear in mind that new revisions of the different major API versions (v0, v1,
v2 etc) are maintained independently.  You can continue to update v0 and v1
after you have pushed v3.

Markdown is supported, following the CommonMark specification.
